## Requirements

- **Java**: Version 8 or higher
- **Maven**: For building the project
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
  
## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/KarandaevRuslan/RetroLauncher/releases) page for your OS
2. Unzip the downloaded archive
3. Locate and run `RetroLauncher` script

## Building from Source

If you want to build the application from source:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarandaevRuslan/RetroLauncher.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd RetroLauncher
   ```

3. Build the project to jlink executable using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean javafx:jlink
   ```

4. Copy the script for your OS from `Scripts` directory to `target\RetroLauncher` directory
5. (Optional) Copy `RetroLauncherUpdater.jar` from `additional tools\RetroLauncherUpdater\out\artifacts` directory to `target\RetroLauncher` directory and rename it to `Updater.jar`

## Usage

After launching the application, you can:

- Add emulators to the supported list
- Add games to the corresponding list
- Configure launch parameters for each emulator and game. `{emu}` variable stores launch parameters common for entire emulator, can be added to game launch parameters string and override position of emulator launch parameters (or else if `{emu}` variable is not in use adds emulator launch parameters in the beginning of the final launch parameters string). `{rom}` variable overrides position of the game path (in the end by default)
- Change user profiles
- Change themes (light, dark) and languages (english, russian)
- Launch games through the appropriate emulators

## Testing

To run tests, execute:

```bash
mvn test
```
